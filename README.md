# Contractor_Project
This Front-End page is a website where individuals who are seeking the best high performance and quailty for construction & carpentry.
Residential or commerical, no job is too big or small for Wright Construction & Carpentry. Customers havee a view of previous jobs or in the process work for the customer to make
the right choice for their work needing to be done. Wright Construction & Carpentry has over 30 years of experience ready to deliver a job well done.

All in all this project is going to be the website for my Construction company in hopes of expanding my business and my legacy! 

In my project I have included a flexbox for the navigation bar  which also includes a hamburger button to open and close the navigation box turning it in to a column which is controlled by Javascript. My mission statement and header are also in flexboxes, which helps with responsiveness when switching to different screen sizes.
